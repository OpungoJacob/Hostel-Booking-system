# Hostel-Booking-system
This repository contains some of the components I personally built with the aim of trying to accomplish the task of building a hostel booking system along side my other 5 team members.
The task of creating the login and signup pages befell me. In addition to developing the front end, i also developed some bit of the back-end logic wiich entailed working with my other team member developing the back-end such that the registration and authorisation logic is managed by the back-end which ran mongodb, node and express and used axios as a way of interlinking the front and back-end.
The final component used for the back-end was  signup-signin-v2 folder.
